# WordPress React Theme

## Requirements

1. **WordPress Version**:
   - This theme requires WordPress version 6.0 or higher. Ensure your WordPress installation meets this requirement to fully utilize the theme's features.

2. **Node.js Version**:
   - Node.js version 20 or higher is required for building and running this theme. Please ensure that your development environment has the appropriate Node.js version installed.

3. **Package Managers**:
   - The theme supports all major package managers, including npm, Yarn, and pnpm. You can choose the package manager that best fits your workflow.

4. **Enable WordPress REST API**:
   - For the theme to function correctly, the WordPress REST API must be enabled. This is generally enabled by default in WordPress, but if it has been disabled, you will need to re-enable it.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - After cloning the theme repository, navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies using your preferred package manager and add folder `templates`:

     ```sh
     # Using npm
     npm install

     # Using Yarn
     yarn install

     # Using pnpm
     pnpm install
     ```

2. **Build the Project**:
   - To prepare the theme for use, build the project by running the build command. This will generate the necessary files and copy them into the `templates` folder:

     ```sh
     npm run build 
     # or
     yarn build
     # or
     pnpm build
     ```

   - After the build process completes, all generated files will be copied into the `templates` folder. This allows you to use the theme as a standalone WordPress theme.

3. **Deploy the Theme**:
   - Move the contents of the `templates` folder into the `wp-content/themes/your-theme-name` directory of your WordPress installation.

4. **Activate the Theme**:
   - Go to the WordPress admin dashboard, navigate to `Appearance` > `Themes`, and activate the theme.

## Additional Notes

- **Development**: For development purposes, you can use the `start` command to run the project in development mode, which enables hot reloading and other development features:

  ```sh
  npm start
  # or
  yarn start
  # or
  pnpm start
